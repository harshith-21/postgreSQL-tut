Overview of Python and PostgreSQL
Overview of Python and PostgreSQL Section
In this section of the course I'll give you a quick overview of how to use the psycopg2 library with Python to interact with a database in PostgreSQl with Python. Please note: this section assumes you know Python and are able to download libraries using Python.

To get started go ahead and download the pyscopg2 library. You can follow the instructions for downloading it here: pyscopg2 Install Instructions (you can just use pip install psycopg2 at your command line//terminal)

I'll be using the Jupyter Notebook system to show the Python code used here, but you can follow along using any editor you prefer. A .py file and a .ipynb file are attached to this lecture as a reference for you!

Let's get started!

Psycopg2 Resources
In the resource section of this lecture is a .py file. (Udemy doesn't allow me to upload the original .ipynb file format at the moment, but I will see if I can circumvent this in the future)
